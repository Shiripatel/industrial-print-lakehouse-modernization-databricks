# 05 – Business Impact

Although this repository uses simulated data, it represents the type of benefits delivered in a real consulting engagement.

## Quantitative Outcomes

- **~40% faster data pipelines** compared to the legacy solution.
- **Stable performance** even during peak ingestion windows.
- **Onboarding time for new PSPs reduced** from multiple days to **under 5 hours** by using parameterized onboarding templates and standardized schemas.
- **Reduction in operational overhead** by consolidating ETL, storage and compute on Databricks.

## Qualitative Outcomes

- A **single, governed data platform** used by operations, finance, product and data science teams.
- **Improved trust in metrics** due to clear lineage from Bronze to Gold.
- **Faster experimentation** for new dashboards and AI models.
- Ability to offer **data-as-a-service** to partners using Delta Sharing, enabling new revenue streams.

## Next Steps (Roadmap)

- Add near real-time streaming ingestion for high-priority events.
- Expand ML use cases (e.g., SLA breach prediction, dynamic pricing, anomaly detection).
- Integrate with enterprise MDM and data catalog solutions for broader discovery.
